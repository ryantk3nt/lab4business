# Lab 4 Business Model

Our company would offer open source medical record software that bypasses the bloated buginess of common software used in this area (many of which are poorly reviewed by actual doctors) to make a seamless experience for patients, doctors, and insurance alike.

The business model is based on an open core model - our company would offer a complete product that is free software licensed under GPL. Our income model is based on offering advanced features/plugins and integration support to larger users like hospitals under a different commercial license.
